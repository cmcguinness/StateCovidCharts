# StateCovidCharts
Generate charts from Covid data at covidtracking.com

There's not a lot to this program -- you hardcode a state, it pulls down the data, and generates some charts.

About the only thing interesting it does is compute some rolling averages of non-cumulative data to smooth out data.
